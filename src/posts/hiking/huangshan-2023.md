# Alone in the Clouds: Mount Huangshan
*November 2023 — Anhui, China*

There is a silence in the mountains that feels heavy, not empty. As I stepped onto the granite stairs of **Mount Huangshan**, the world below disappeared into a thick blanket of white.

## The Ascent

The path winds upward like a stone serpent. Pine trees, twisted by centuries of wind, cling to the vertical rock faces. They call them *Yingkesong* — welcoming pines — but in this mist, they looked more like guardians.

## Geological Time

Walking here is an exercise in perspective. These formations were carved by glaciers during the Quaternary Glaciation. Every step is a step through millions of years of erosion.

It reminds me of code, in a way. The layers of abstraction we build are like these sedimentary layers—fragile, yet capable of standing the test of time if the foundation is solid.

## Mist and Stone

> "The mountains are high and the emperor is far away."

Standing on the Lotus Peak, surrounded by nothing but shifting vapor and jagged stone, that old proverb felt visceral. Here, the only authority is gravity, and the only timeline is geological.
